It includes all deaths that occurred and were registered in Australia, including deaths of persons whose place of usual residence was overseas. Deaths of Australian residents that occurred outside Australia may be registered by individual Registrars, but are not included in Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) death statistics.<br/><br/>\n\nStandardised death rates in this dataset differ from those in the ABS.Stat datasets and commentary. Standardised death rates in this dataset are averaged using data for the three years ending in the reference year. They are calculated for each calendar year and then averaged. Standardised death rates in the ABS.Stat datasets and commentary are based on death registration data for the reference year only. Null values represent data not available for publication<br/><br/>\n\nThis dataset uses deaths and estimated resident population (ERP) for Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Australia for 30 June 2012 to 2019, according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). ERP is final for 2012 to 2016, revised for 2017 & 2018 and preliminary for 2019, based on the 2016 Census of Population and Housing. Data has been sourced from the September 2020 release.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information including which ERP was used in this dataset please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/deaths-australia-methodology/2019#explanatory-notes\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Explanatory Notes</a>.<br/><br/> AURIN has spatially enabled the original data from the ABS with the 2016 GCCSA boundaries.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"gcc_code16","type":"String","title":"GCCSA Code","description":"GCCSA Code (ASGS 2016).","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"_2012_deaths","type":"Integer","title":"Number of Deaths 2012","description":"Number of deaths, 2012.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"_2012_est_res_population","type":"Integer","title":"Estimated Resident Population 2012","description":"Estimated resident population, 2012.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"_2012_std_death_rate","type":"Double","title":"Standardised Death Rate 2012","description":"Standardised death rate.
