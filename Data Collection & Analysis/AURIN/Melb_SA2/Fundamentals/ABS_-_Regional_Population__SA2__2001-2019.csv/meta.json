The data is aggregated to 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2).\n<br><br>\n\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimated resident population is based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census.\n<br><br>\n\nThis data is sourced from the <a
